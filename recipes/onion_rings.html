    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, or as needed1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice onion into 1/4-inch-thick rings. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place a wire rack over a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Prepare breading station by setting out 3 wide, shallow dishes. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in the first dish. Whisk milk and egg together in the second dish. Place bread crumbs in the third dish.</li>
        <li>Dip each onion ring into the flour mixture, turning several times until fully coated with flour. </li>
        <li>Transfer to the egg mixture and use a fork to turn until coated. Lift onion with the fork and shake gently so excess liquid drips back into the dish.</li>
        <li>Place onion in the bread crumbs and turn several times to coat, scooping crumbs over the ring if necessary.</li>
        <li>Lift again with the fork, tap any excess bread crumbs back into the dish, and place on the wire rack while you prepare the remaining onion rings.</li>
        <li>Deep-fry 3 to 4 onion rings at a time in the preheated oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels while you deep-fry the remaining rings.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with seasoning salt before serving.</li>
    </ol>
